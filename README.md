This code is part of learning process. 
In this code you can find ideas from other sources. These sources are written bellow: 
Print a table after reading a file: https://forums.oracle.com/ords/apexds/post/creating-columns-dynamically-6981
Table: createColumn() method. 
The creation of the columns was already implemented from before that but the way to fill the table is fully loaned. 

For reading XML file I used lots of sources but the most helpful and informative ones were: source https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61948901/java-get-tag-name-of-a-node and a very special credits to Professor Saad and his video Read XML Document in Java using DOM found on link-> https://youtu.be/2JH5YeQ68H8
Just like reading CSV and JSON I needed to create an Array of columns so I had to find that first row and get its columns with the assumtion that the amount and name of them will be the same. 
Then I found the name of the attribute, in that case row.
