This code is part of learning process. 
In this code you can find ideas from other sources. These sources are written bellow: 
Print a table after reading a file: https://forums.oracle.com/ords/apexds/post/creating-columns-dynamically-6981
Table: createColumn() method. 
The creation of the columns was already implemented from before that but the way to fill the table is fully loaned.
